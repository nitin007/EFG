## Getting started

You will need MySQL and an app-specific MySQL user - see `config/database.yml` for details.

    bundle install
    rake db:create
    rake db:reset

To run the tests in parallel across multiple cores create the correct number of databases for your machine and run `rake` as usual:

    rake parallel:create
    rake
